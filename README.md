# Hey, I'm Victor CRYPRT

## Web3 Builder | BD & Marketing Strategist | Community Architect

Welcome to my GitHub — the buildspace for everything I'm working on, collaborating with, or growing in Web3.

### What I Do

- **Business Development & Fundraising:**  
  I help crypto startups raise capital, structure investor narratives, and connect with top-tier VCs.

- **Community & Growth Strategy:**  
  From 0 → 70,000 members. I’ve built Telegram & X (Twitter) communities that drive engagement, retention, and growth.

- **Narrative & Product Marketing:**  
  Memecoins, ReFi, DeFi, tools — I shape narratives that go viral, raise funds, or attract users like a magnet.

- **Founder Support:**  
  I work directly with founders to bring vision → traction, helping design growth loops, tokenomics feedback, and market entry strategies.

### Projects I’ve Worked On

- **FOMO Coin:**  
  Helped grow community to 150K followers on X and 70K on Telegram  
  → Memecoin meets community virality

- **MindDAO:**  
  Web3 mental health initiative  
  → Strategy, growth, and storytelling

- **ReFi:**  
  Doing stuff in regenerative finance  
  → 🧱👷‍♂️🏗️

(And more in stealth mode…)
